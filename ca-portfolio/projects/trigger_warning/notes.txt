Trigger warning ---------------

Countless survivors of sexual assault recount having been "unable to move" during the event.

In short they [involuntarily] play dead.

An empathy machine of sorts. One person enters at a time; trapped, stripped of their power and forced to reconcile with how that feels. The experience lasts 00:02:00 minutes, the frequency with which sexual assaults occur in the United States. While immersed the only light source comes from pulsating red circles that methodiclaly expand and contract in response to the soundscape of a heart, beating at 30BPM.

Engineer an installation, using sexual assault statistics, that transforms human data into a personal, transportational experience.

One person enters at a time; unable to leave the space for 00:02:00 minutes. The only source of light comes from pulsating, red, nested circles projected from above & behind, expanding and contracting in response to the soundscape of a heart beating at 40BPM.
