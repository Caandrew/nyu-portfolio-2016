Feelings of angst permeate through (8s, 5w)
consuming me (4s, 2w)

My heart beats in concert with racing thoughts (10s, 8w)
about you and me; us (6s, 5w)

Gasping for air (4s, 3w)
holding my breath (4s, 3w)
My only hope is that you won't walk away when (12s, 10w)
I do what we have always done (8s, 7w)
