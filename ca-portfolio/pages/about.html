  CA -> AZ -> SEA -> NYC. 

  <p>Cy Andrews is an experiential designer and creative technologist based in Brooklyn, New York. Through her work she explores how future technologies can be used to create new paradigms for visual communication.</p>

  <p>She received her Bachelor’s degree in Art History from Arizona State University in 2010. Towards the end of her degree program, Cy came to the realization that she was basically studying the history of visual communication, and became increasingly curious about contemporary use of visual storytelling techniques — especially in advertising. </p>

  <p>Cy soon relocated to Seattle Washington to attend graduate school at the University of Washington where she further explored this newfound interest. Here, she gravitated towards the conceptual, building brand identities and, finding new and innovative ways of reaching users . It was also here, by way of analyzing client data, that she was bitten by the “data viz” bug. </p>

  <p>She began exploring implications for data visualization as a storytelling device, to communicate complex ideas and information, to the general population — in a way that’s digestible; easily understood. During her final semester of study, she was named the Inaugural Data Visualization Intern on the National Digital team at NBC Universal and moved to New York. </p>

  <p>Cy flourished at NBC — learning the ins and outs of data journalism — and was subsequently hired full time. During her tenure there, she found herself thinking more and more about the field of data visualization as a whole —  while simultaneously being drawn towards the XR space — and posited the question: what does data visualization looks like in the context of XR?</p>

  <p>As a means to equip herself with the guidance and access to technology necessary to further explore this question she applied, and was admitted, to NYU’s Tandon School of Engineering; where she currently studies, creating work that spans the virtuality continuum, and redefines data visualization.</p>

  <p>Cy has spoken at an array of events and conferences, including the ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing — where her original research on the spread of misinformation via Twitter was published in 2016.</p>
