		<p>Cy Andrews is an experiential designer and creative technologist based in New York. A visionary in her own right Cy’s diverse background in art history, digital communication, and engineering, paired with her unique way of thinking, results in generating ideas that truly push the limit of what is possible. Her work, which, however subtley, is always rooted in data, spans the virtuality continuum, from physical manifestations of cosmic noise wayvelengths, to [multi-sensory] data visceralization.</p>
		<p>Most recently, Cynthia worked with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at NASA to implement augmented reality in “clean” rooms where spacecrafts are built, and was named Artist in Residence at VRAccelorator — where she is exploring how motion and emotion can be used, in tandum, to create experiences that elicit a sense of childlike wonder and awe — and provide sociological value.</p>
		<p>Cy has spoken at an array of events and conferences, including the ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing — where her original research on the spread of misinformation via Twitter was published in 2016.</p>
